The Q1 2022 update covers the months of January, February,\nMarch 2022. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q2 2022: April, May, and June 2022\n• Powerful storm leaves many Ottawa businesses and residents without power: A derecho with\nwind speeds up to 190 km/h came through south Ottawa on May 21, 2022, causing extensive\ndamage along its path. Many trees and hydro poles were toppled over, leaving nearly 180,000\nhouseholds without power for several days. Hydro and clean-up crews worked diligently to\nrestore power and return things back to normal, while Council passed a motion to waive\ndemolition and building permit fees for those looking to rebuild following the storm.\n• Lansdowne revitalization gets Committee and Council go-ahead: On May 6th, the City’s\nFinance and Economic Development Committee voted in favour of the $330 million plan to\nrelocate the Civic Centre arena and replace the north-side stands with 1,200 new rental\napartment and condo units, of which 120 will be affordable units. On June 8th, Council approved\nthe business plan and funding strategy for the plan and city staff are to return with a follow-up\nreport in the next Term of Council detailing costs, legal amendments, and public consultation\nfeedback.\n• Ontario PCs win another majority government: The Ontario Progressive Conservatives won 83\nseats and a second consecutive majority government on June 2nd, 2022. The NDP formed the\nofficial opposition again with 31 seats, and both the NDP and Liberal parties will be seeking new\nleadership following the resignations of their party leaders.\n• Planning Committee approves affordable housing spending plan: On June 9th, the City’s\nPlanning Committee approved a $33.7 million dollar spending plan to create new affordable\nhousing and stabilize projects currently underway. This will help fund approx. 300 new,\n1\npermanent affordable units to bring the total number of affordable units under development\nacross Ottawa to 1,500.\nWhat Happened in Q1 2022: January, February, March 2022\n• Government support for Ottawa businesses impacted by the convoy protests: For several\nweeks in February an illegal blockade in Downtown Ottawa prevented many local businesses\nfrom being able to operate safely, resulting in significant financial losses. Investments of $20\nmillion by the federal government and $10 million by the province will allow each small business\nimpacted by the protests to apply for up to $10,000 in federal funding and $5,000 in provincial\nfunding through Invest Ottawa. The City of Ottawa has also passed several measures to provide\nfinancial relief to affected businesses, including $450,000 in funding to affected BIAs and a\ndeferral of interim 2022 property taxes in the areas impacted by the occupation.\n• Ontario lifts capacity restrictions, vaccine and mask mandates: With a plan to lift all pandemic\nrestrictions by April 27th, 2022, capacity limits and proof of vaccination policies ended for most\nindoor settings as of March 1st, with mandatory vaccination policies ending in hospitals, long-\nterm care homes, schools, and child-care settings on March 14th. However, individual\norganizations can choose to keep their own requirements in place. Most mask mandates were\nlifted as of March 21st, however, mandatory masking is still required in healthcare settings, jails,\nshelters, and on public transit and may need to be reinstated if a new variant emerges.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ1-2021 Q4-2021 Q1-2022 Status Compared to\nCategory\nQ1-2021\nEmployed Labour 579,500 580,300 585,200 \nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 6.7% 4.9% 5.0% \nPositive\nParticipation Rate 67.7% 65.5% 65.7% \nNegative\nHousing Starts 1,974 2,815 1,521 \nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $717,971 $714,450 $820,957 \nNegative\nResale Units Sold 3,407 2,950 3,249 \nNegative\nPopulation N/A 1,046,440 N/A \nNeutral\nInflation 2.1% 5.5% 6.6% \nNegative\nAverage Weekly $1,308 $1,289 $1,279 \nNegative\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $1,097,688 $995,573 $908,020 \nNegative\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Availability 9.4% 12.3% 11.7% \nNegative\nRate\nRetail Vacancy Rate N/A 3.1% N/A \nNeutral\nIndustrial Vacancy 4.4% 2.0% 2.3% \nPositive\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n3\nLabour Force\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q1-21 Q4-21 Q1-22\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 621.0 610.2 616.0\nEmployed (x 1,000) 579.5 580.3 585.2\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 41.4 29.8 30.8\nUnemployment Rate 6.7% 4.9% 5.0%\nParticipation Rate 67.7% 65.5% 65.7%\n*2016 boundaries\nOver the past year, the labour force decreased by 0.8%\nwhile employed residents increased by 1.0%.

The Q1 2023 update covers the months of January, February,\nand March 2023. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q2 2023: April, May, June 2023\n• Federal government releases a ‘disposal list’ properties: As federal public servants shift to a\nhybrid work model and office vacancy rates hit 12.3% in Q1 2023, the federal government\nreleased a list of 10 buildings that it is planning to dispose of in the National Capital Region.\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada suggested that the properties listed could be used for\naffordable housing or community or commercial space. However, real estate experts note that\nthe majority of the properties listed are older and would require extensive work and cost to be\nrepurposed.\n• Council approves the City’s first nightlife economy action plan: On May 10, 2023, Council\napproved the nightlife economy action plan to develop and promote activities and experiences\nfrom 6 pm to 6 am. The action plan includes a framework for a nightlife commissioner’s or\n“night mayor’s” office to launch in 2024 and will consider changes to City by-laws, policies,\nprocedures, and services that support the nightlife economy. The goal is to improve job\ncreation, attract talent and investment, promote economic growth, and foster tourism and city\nbranding.\n• Federal public servant strike: Over 150,000 federal public servants across 30 departments and\nagencies went on strike between April 19th to early May after the federal government and the\nPublic Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) failed to reach a deal over issues such as wage increases\nto keep up with inflation and remote work policies. Now that tentative agreements have been\nreached, some small businesses in the downtown core are missing the extra foot traffic of\nworkers on the picket lines as they return to hybrid work.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q1 2023: January, February, March 2023\n• City of Ottawa named one of Canada’s Best Diversity Employers: In March 2023, the City of\nOttawa was named one of Canada’s Best Diversity Employers for the 11th time for the work\ndone to create an equitable, inclusive, and diverse workplace. The City was also recognized for\nits first Anti-Racism Strategy, which is a five-year plan to proactively identify and remove\nsystemic barriers from City policies, programs and services.\n• Federal employees return to the office: By March 31, 2023, federal public servants will be\nrequired to return to the office 2-3 days per week. The move to a hybrid work arrangement will\nbe a phased transition starting January 16th, 2023, in order to ensure fairness and equity to\nhybrid work across the federal government. Unions have opposed the mandate, saying it is\nunjustified and that taxpayer money is saved having employees work from home, while Mayor\nMark Sutcliffe and businesses downtown applaud the decision that is expected to benefit the\npublic transit system and local economy.\n• New direct flight route between Europe and Ottawa: On February 2nd, 2023, Air France\nannounced that it will launch flights between the Ottawa International Airport and Paris Charles\nde Gaulle Airport starting in June. This will be the first direct route between Ottawa and Europe\nsince 2020 with the hope to restore international business and leisure travel to the National\nCapital Region and boost the local tourism economy.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ1-2022 Q4-2022 Q1-2023 Status Compared to\nQ1-2022\nEmployed Labour 591,167 619,100 625,867 \nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 4.6% 4.0% 3.9% \nPositive\nParticipation Rate 66.2% 67.7% 67.9% \nPositive\nHousing Starts 1,521 1,814 1,626 \nPositive\nAverage Resale Price $820,957 $671,248 $698,437 \nPositive\nResale Units Sold 3,249 1,882 1,986 \nNegative\nPopulation N/A 1,067,310 N/A \nNeutral\nInflation 6.6% 6.5% 5.4% \nPositive\nAverage Weekly $1,279 $1,318 $1,387 \nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $957,009 $836,409 $844,920 \nNegative\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 9.8% 11.2% 12.3% \nNegative\nRetail Vacancy Rate N/A 3.6% N/A \nNeutral\nIndustrial Vacancy 2.3% 2.5% 2.9% \nNegative\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n3\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\n9.0%\n8.0%\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q1-22 Q4-22 Q1-23\n7.0%\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 619.9 645.2 651.3\n6.0%\nEmployed (x 1,000) 591.2 619.1 625.9 5.0%\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 28.8 26.1 25.5 4.0%\nUnemployment Rate 4.6% 4.0% 3.9% 3.0%\nParticipation Rate 66.2% 67.7% 67.9% 2.0%\n1.0%\n*2016 boundaries\n0.0%\nOver the past year, the labour force increased by 5.1%\nwhile employed residents increased by 5.9%.

According to the report, developed in collaboration with the Canadian Urban\nInstitute, the $1.3 billion would come from an annual revenue increase of $1.2 billion in new\nlocal spending, and more than $133 million in annual property tax revenues. The report calls for\nthe addition of 40,000 new residents and the creation of 50,000 jobs by 2034.

    "content": "Economic Development Update Q2 2022\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q2 2022 update covers the months of April, May, and\nJune 2022. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q3 2022: July, August, and September 2022\n• Nationwide Rogers Outage: On July 8th, 2022, Rogers customers lost cell service and internet\naccess across Canada as a result of a massive network outage. The outage cost some small\nbusinesses thousands of dollars as they were unable to process Interac payments and online\norders. It also raised concerns over national security and public safety as 9-1-1 calls were unable\nto be made and other government services, hospital emergency systems, and border crossings\nwere impacted. Rogers explained that the outage was a result of a network system failure\nfollowing an update in its core IP network and that they would explore how they could work\nwith other Canadian carriers to avoid future widespread outages. They would also credit all\ncustomers with the equivalent of five days of service fees.\n• Bank of Canada Interest Rate Hikes: The Bank of Canada increased its key interest rate by a full\npercentage point on July 13th, 2022 and another 0.75 points on September 7th, 2022 to sit at\n3.25%. This was following three previous rate hikes in March, April, and June in an effort to curb\nrising inflation and cool a hot market by discouraging consumer spending. We’ve already seen\nhousing prices and sales decrease in Q2 and Q3 as mortgage and loan rates rise. Further interest\nrate hikes are expected to hit 4.0% by the end of the year.\n• New fleet of trains for Stage 2 LRT and $380 million invested on zero-emission buses: In\nAugust 2022, the Canada Infrastructure Bank and the City of Ottawa closed on a $380 million\ninvestment to cover the capital costs of up to 446 zero-emission OC Transpo buses. This follows\nthe City of Ottawa unveiling seven new Stadler FLIRT trains for the Stage 2 Light Rail Transit\n(LRT) O-Train South extension in July 2022. Each train will be able to carry up to 420 passengers\nalong the main O-Train South line.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q2 2022: April, May, June 2022\n• Powerful storm leaves many Ottawa businesses and residents without power: A derecho with\nwind speeds up to 190 km/h came through south Ottawa on May 21, 2022, causing extensive\ndamage along its path.

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q2 2023\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q2 2023 update covers the months of April, May, and\nJune 2023. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q3 2023: July, August, September 2023\n• Bank of Canada interest rate hike: The Bank of Canada raised the key interest rate to 5% in July,\nthe highest it’s been since 2001, in an effort to bring inflation back down to 2%. Many experts\nbelieve that this will be the last rate hike of the year as signs of economic softening, such as\nrising unemployment rates, have been observed. However, the recent uptick in the Canadian\ninflation rate from 2.8% in June to 3.3% in July increases the odds of another rate hike come\nSeptember.\n• Porter to offer new direct flights from Ottawa: Porter Airlines has announced that it will expand\nits network of direct connections to Western Canada and the United States. Direct flights from\nOttawa to Vancouver became available in July and the airline is to offer direct flights from\nOttawa to Edmonton starting in October and to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, as of\nNovember. These new routes are expected to help strengthen the local business and tourism\neconomy in Ottawa.\n• Multiple new residential developments proposed: New developments put forth by Katasa\nGroup, Brigil, Colonnade Bridgeport, Taggart Realty Management, The Anglican Diocese of\nOttawa, Ottawa Community Housing, and CLV Group would result in over 3,200 new residential\nunits across multiple housing projects in Ottawa, with approx. 225 of those units to be\naffordable housing and 139 units to be office-to-rental conversions. Proposed sites include the\nold Greyhound bus terminal, an expansion of the Plant Recreation Centre, and a vacant office\nbuilding on Laurier Avenue West.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q2 2023: January, February, March 2023\n• Poor air quality and smoky conditions from wildfires: In June, unprecedented wildfires in\nQuebec and Southeastern Ontario resulted in high levels of smoke and air pollution for several\ndays in Ottawa and nearby municipalities. People were advised to avoid outdoor activities and\nto take precautions when working outside. Small businesses and tourism operators were also\nimpacted by cancellations and rescheduling as tourists opted for indoor activities.\n• Federal government releases a ‘disposal list’ properties: As federal public servants shift to a\nhybrid work model and office vacancy rates hit 12.3% in Q1 2023, the federal government\nreleased a list of 10 buildings that it is planning to dispose of in the National Capital Region.\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada suggested that the properties listed could be used for\naffordable housing or community or commercial space. However, real estate experts note that\nthe majority of the properties listed are older and would require extensive work and cost to be\nrepurposed.\n• Federal public servant strike: Over 150,000 federal public servants across 30 departments and\nagencies went on strike between April 19th to early May after the federal government and the\nPublic Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) failed to reach a deal over issues such as wage increases\nto keep up with inflation and remote work policies. Now that tentative agreements have been\nreached, some small businesses in the downtown core are missing the extra foot traffic of\nworkers on the picket lines as they return to hybrid work.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ2-2022 Q1-2023 Q2-2023 Status Compared to\nQ2-2022\nEmployed Labour 609,567 625,867 632,000 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 4.3% 3.9% 4.3% \nNeutral\nParticipation Rate 67.6% 67.9% 68.3% ✓\nPositive\nHousing Starts 2,144 1,626 1,688 \nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $801,524 $698,437 $746,490 ✓\nPositive\nResale Units Sold 3,941 1,986 3,867 \nNegative\nPopulation 1,056,750 N/A 1,077,900 ✓\nPositive\nInflation 7.4% 5.4% 3.8% ✓\nPositive\nAverage Weekly $1,279 $1,387 $1,413 ✓\nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $1,015,729 $844,547 $866,651 \nNegative\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 9.7% 12.3% 12.9% \nNegative\nRetail Vacancy Rate 3.7% N/A 2.9% ✓\nPositive\nIndustrial Vacancy 1.8% 2.9% 2.2% \nNegative\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n3\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\n8.0%\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q2-22 Q1-23 Q2-23\n7.0%\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 637.0 651.3 660.5\n6.0%\nEmployed (x 1,000) 609.6 625.9 632.0\n5.0%\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 27.4 25.5 28.5\n4.0%\nUnemployment Rate 4.3% 3.9% 4.3%\n3.0%\nParticipation Rate 67.6% 67.9% 68.3%\n2.0%\n*2016 boundaries\n1.0%\n0.0%\nYear-over-year, both the overall labour force and\nemployed labour force increased by 3.7%, while the\nunemployment rate ultimately stayed the same.

This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q3 2023: July, August, September 2023\n• Bank of Canada interest rate hike: The Bank of Canada raised the key interest rate to 5% in July,\nthe highest it’s been since 2001, in an effort to bring inflation back down to 2%. Many experts\nbelieve that this will be the last rate hike of the year as signs of economic softening, such as\nrising unemployment rates, have been observed. However, the recent uptick in the Canadian\ninflation rate from 2.8% in June to 3.3% in July increases the odds of another rate hike come\nSeptember.\n• Porter to offer new direct flights from Ottawa: Porter Airlines has announced that it will expand\nits network of di",

Direct flights from\nOttawa to Vancouver became available in July and the airline is to offer direct flights from\nOttawa to Edmonton starting in October and to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, as of\nNovember. These new routes are expected to help strengthen the local business and tourism\neconomy in Ottawa.\n• Multiple new residential developments proposed: New developments put forth by Katasa\nGroup, Brigil, Colonnade Bridgeport, Taggart Realty Management, The Anglican Diocese of\nOttawa, Ottawa Community Housing, and CLV Group would result in over 3,200 new residential\nunits across multiple housing projects in Ottawa, with approx. 225 of those units to be\naffordable housing and 139 units to be office-to-rental conversions.",

People were advised to avoid outdoor activities and\nto take precautions when working outside.

However, real estate experts note that\nthe majority of the properties listed are older and would require extensive work and cost to be\nrepurposed.\n• Federal public servant strike: Over 150,000 federal public servants across 30 departments and\nagencies went on strike between April 19th to early May after the federal government and the\nPublic Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) failed to reach a deal over issues such as wage increases\nto keep up with inflation and remote work policies.",

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q2 2024\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q2 2024 update covers the months of April, May, and\nJune 2024. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q3 2024: July, August, September 2024\n• The federal government identified 56 properties for conversion to affordable housing,\nincluding 22 properties in Ottawa: The Canada Public Land Bank, launched on August 25, 2024,\nfeatures 56 federal properties across Canada, including 22 in the city of Ottawa, that have been\nidentified as being able to support housing. Former military bases, Canada Post sites and federal\noffice buildings are among the properties currently included in the public lands bank, many of\nwhich were previously set aside for sale as they are no longer in use. The new plan is to offer\nmost of the properties for long-term lease rather than one-time sale to keep the lands in public\nhands and ensure housing built on them remains affordable. The current list includes properties\nin 28 municipalities in seven provinces but will grow over time through an ongoing review of\nunderused or vacant federal land and buildings.\n• Canada’s inflation rate fell to 2.5% in July, which is the lowest since March 2021: Canada’s\nannual inflation rate fell to 2.5 percent in July 2024, matching economists’ forecasts, and\nsolidifying expectations for a third consecutive interest rate cut in September. The consumer\nprice index report published in August by Statistics Canada notes that prices for travel tours,\npassenger vehicles and electricity helped drive the headline figure lower. Meanwhile, shelter\ncosts are still the main driver of inflation as Canadians face significantly higher rents and\nmortgage payments. The report also noted, however, that shelter price growth slowed in July\n2024 to 5.7 percent year-over-year, down from 6.2 percent in June of 2023. Inflation has\nremained below three percent since January 2024 and has steadily trended lower, highlighting\nthe significant progress made in the fight against high inflation.\n1\n• Sparks Street Business Improvement Area (BIA) expansion to aid in downtown revitalization\nefforts: The Sparks Street BIA association announced plans to expand its boundaries beyond the\ntraditional pedestrian mall into a broader part of the downtown core. The decision to pursue\nexpansion was originally prompted by the pandemic, since the organization realized that many\ndowntown businesses are outside the boundaries of existing BIAs. The value of the expansion\nhas also been bolstered in the past year by the efforts of local business leaders to revitalize the\ndowntown. As per the schedule, the expansion is said to come into effect on January 1, 2025.\nWhat Happened in Q2 2024: April, May, June 2024\n• Ottawa-Gatineau unemployment rate soars to 6% in June: Ottawa-Gatineau’s unemployment\nrate climbed to its highest level in nearly three years last month as the local economy shed more\nthan 2,000 jobs and more people entered the labour force (as reported by Statistics Canada in\nits monthly labour force survey report for June).\n• New downtown action plan proposes strategies to create $1.3B in annual economic benefit: A\nnew report from the Ottawa Board of Trade sets out an actionable path forward for the\ndowntown. According to the report, developed in collaboration with the Canadian Urban\nInstitute, the $1.3 billion would come from an annual revenue increase of $1.2 billion in new\nlocal spending, and more than $133 million in annual property tax revenues. The report calls for\nthe addition of 40,000 new residents and the creation of 50,000 jobs by 2034. The plan also\nproposes a joint $500-million fund to kickstart a series of catalytic projects, including significant\nenhancements to the public realms of Sparks Street and ByWard Market and the establishment\nof a new business incubation district and an arts/culture corridor.\n• Porter eyeing direct flights from Ottawa to California, the Caribbean and other destinations:\nPorter Airlines plans to add direct flights from Ottawa to Florida’s Gulf Coast, California, the\nCaribbean and other destinations over the next two years as it looks to cement the capital’s\nstatus as a major hub for the carrier. The airline is targeting cities such as Los Angeles, San\nFrancisco and Las Vegas as well as the west coast of Florida and the Caribbean for its next direct\nroutes from the Ottawa International Airport (YOW), as it expects to become YOW’s top carrier\nin terms of daily flights and passenger traffic. Porter also expects to nearly double its number of\nOttawa-based employees to 450 from the current total of 250 by the end of 2024.\n• Ottawa home sales rose 8.9% in April: According to the Ottawa Real Estate Board (OREB), home\nsales in Ottawa jumped 8.9 percent in April compared with the same month last year as mutual\nconfidence among both buyers and sellers gave the market a lift. OREB said 1,456 homes\nchanged hands last month, two percent fewer than the five-year average. However, the\nindustry’s recent recovery continued, with a total of 4,132 transactions in the first four months\nof 2024, an increase of 11.5 percent from the same period last year.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ2-2023 Q1-2024 Q2-2024 Year-over-year Status:\nQ2 2024 Compared to\nQ2-2023\nEmployed Labour 633,233 655,833 646,100 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 4.5% 4.7% 5.6% \nNegative\nParticipation Rate 68.5% 69.1% 68.0% \nNegative\nHousing Starts 1,688 1,080 1,450 \nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $673,865 $655,047 $694,112 \nNegative\nResale Units Sold 5,085 2,680 4,440 \nNegative\nPopulation 1,077,900 1,083,550* 1,094,340 ✓\nPositive\nInflation 3.8% 2.0% 2.6% ✓\nPositive\nAverage Weekly $1,413 $1,436 $1,455 ✓\nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $817,028 $714,463 $976,375 ✓\nPositive\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 12.9% 12.0% 11.5% ✓\nPositive\nRetail Vacancy Rate 1.9% 1.9% 1.9% \nNeutral\nIndustrial Vacancy 2.2% 3.0% 3.5% \nNegative\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n*Population data is available bi-annually for quarters Q2 and Q4.\n3\nLabour Force\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\n7.0%\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q2-23 Q1-24 Q2-24 6.0%\n5.0%\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 662.7 688.0 684.2\n4.0%\nEmployed (x 1,000) 633.2 655.8 646.1\n3.0%\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 29.4 32.1 38.1\n2.0%\nUnemployment Rate 4.5% 4.7% 5.6%\n1.0%\nParticipation Rate 68.5% 69.1% 68.0%\n0.0%\n*2016 boundaries\nYear-over-year, the overall labour force increased 3.2%\nwhile employed residents increased by 2.0%.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate also increased 1.1\npercentage points from Q2 2023.

    "content": "Economic Development Update Q3 2022\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q3 2022 update covers the months of July, August, and\nSeptember 2022. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q4 2022: October, November, December 2022\n• Ottawa’s Municipal Election: Mark Sutcliffe became Ottawa’s new mayor with over 51% of the\nvotes. A broadcaster and entrepreneur, he campaigned on fiscal frugality and “cross-partisan”\nsupport. He promises to keep property tax increases at 2.5% in 2023 and 2024 and to cut $35\nmillion in municipal spending. There were also a number of new faces elected to city council,\nwith 11 new city councillors who weren’t in office at the end of the previous term.\n• Nokia Canada to Construct ‘World-Leading’ Facility in Kanata: In October, Nokia Canada\nannounced it would replace its existing facility in the Kanata North Business Park with a new\n“world-leading, sustainable research and development hub” starting in 2023. The new hub\nwould include an office complex with ground-floor commercial and retail space as well as 11\nresidential high-rises containing up to 1,900 units. Slated to open in 2026, it is expected to\ncreate over 340 jobs and draw global talent to Ottawa’s tech sector.\n• Ontario businesses can now pass credit card fees onto customers: In response to a class-action\nlawsuit by merchants against Visa, MasterCard, and other financial institutions, businesses\nacross Canada (with the exception of Quebec) can now add surcharges to customer bills when\nthey choose to pay by credit card. The average credit card transaction fee is 1.4 percent with a\ncap of 2.4 percent for small merchants and more expensive cards like American Express.\nBusinesses were previously forbidden from passing on these costs onto customers. Small\nbusiness advocates welcome the change and 1-in-5 small businesses plan to implement the fee\nas credit cards are one of the most expensive methods of payment for merchants.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q3 2022: July, August, September 2022\n• Nationwide Rogers Outage: On July 8th, 2022, Rogers customers lost cell service and internet\naccess across Canada as a result of a massive network outage. The outage cost some small\nbusinesses thousands of dollars as they were unable to process Interac payments and online\norders. It also raised concerns over national security and public safety as 9-1-1 calls were unable\nto be made and other government services, hospital emergency systems, and border crossings\nwere impacted. Rogers explained that the outage was a result of a network system failure\nfollowing an update in its core IP network and that they would explore how they could work\nwith other Canadian carriers to avoid future widespread outages. They would also credit all\ncustomers with the equivalent of five days of service fees.\n• Bank of Canada Interest Rate Hikes: The Bank of Canada increased its key interest rate by a full\npercentage point on July 13th, 2022 and another 0.75 points on September 7th, 2022 to sit at\n3.25%. This was following three previous rate hikes in March, April, and June in an effort to curb\nrising inflation and cool a hot market by discouraging consumer spending. We’ve already seen\nhousing prices and sales decrease in Q2 and Q3 as mortgage and loan rates rise. Further interest\nrate hikes are expected to hit 4.0% by the end of the year.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ3-2021 Q2-2022 Q3-2022 Status Compared to\nQ3-2021\nEmployed Labour 596,200 609,800 607,600 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 6.2% 4.7% 3.7% ✓\nPositive\nParticipation Rate 68.7% 67.8% 66.6% \nNegative\nHousing Starts 2,097 2,144 4,598 ✓\nPositive\nAverage Resale Price $687,343 $801,524 $710,241 \nNegative\nResale Units Sold 4,903 3,941 2,506 \nNegative\nPopulation N/A 1,056,750 N/A \nNeutral\nInflation 4.9% 7.4% 7.2% \nNegative\nAverage Weekly $1,293 $1,279 $1,308 ✓\nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $972,757 $958,568 $1,066,447 ✓\nPositive\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 9.3% 9.7% 10.6% \nNegative\nRetail Vacancy Rate N/A 3.7% N/A \nNeutral\nIndustrial Vacancy 4.5% 1.8% 2.0% ✓\nPositive\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n3\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\n9.0%\n8.0%\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q3-21 Q2-22 Q3-22\n7.0%\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 635.9 639.4 630.7\n6.0%\nEmployed (x 1,000) 596.2 609.8 607.6\n5.0%\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 39.7 29.7 23.2 4.0%\nUnemployment Rate 6.2% 4.7% 3.7% 3.0%\nParticipation Rate 68.7% 67.8% 66.6% 2.0%\n1.0%\n*2016 boundaries\n0.0%\nSince Q3 last year, the labour force decreased by 0.8%\nwhile employed residents increased by 1.9%.

      "Economic Development Update Q3 2022\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q3 2022 update covers the months of July, August, and\nSeptember 2022. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q4 2022: October, November, December 2022\n• Ottawa’s Municipal Election: Mark Sutcliffe became Ottawa’s new mayor with over 51% of the\nvotes. A broadcaster and entrepreneur, he campaigned on fiscal frugality and “cross-partisan”\nsupport. He promises to keep property tax increases at 2.5% in 2023 and 2024 and to cut $35\nmillion in municipal spending. There were also a number of new faces elected to city council,\nwith 11 new city councillors who weren’t in office at the end of the previous term.\n• Nokia Canada to Construct ‘World-Leading’ Facility in Kanata: In October, Nokia Canada\nannounced it would replace its existing facility i",

The new hub\nwould include an office complex with ground-floor commercial and retail space as well as 11\nresidential high-rises containing up to 1,900 units. Slated to open in 2026, it is expected to\ncreate over 340 jobs and draw global talent to Ottawa’s tech sector.\n• Ontario businesses can now pass credit card fees onto customers: In response to a class-action\nlawsuit by merchants against Visa, MasterCard, and other financial institutions, businesses\nacross Canada (with the exception of Quebec) can now add surcharges to customer bills when\nthey choose to pay by credit card.",
      "ts against Visa, MasterCard, and other financial institutions, businesses\nacross Canada (with the exception of Quebec) can now add surcharges to customer bills when\nthey choose to pay by credit card. The average credit card transaction fee is 1.4 percent with a\ncap of 2.4 percent for small merchants and more expensive cards like American Express.\nBusinesses were previously forbidden from passing on these costs onto customers. Small\nbusiness advocates welcome the change and 1-in-5 small businesses plan to implement the fee\nas credit cards are one of the most expensive methods of payment for merchants.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q3 2022: July, August, September 2022\n• Nationwide Rogers Outage: On July 8th, 2022, Rogers customers lost cell service and internet\naccess across Canada as a result of a massive network outage.

      "nd internet\naccess across Canada as a result of a massive network outage. The outage cost some small\nbusinesses thousands of dollars as they were unable to process Interac payments and online\norders. It also raised concerns over national security and public safety as 9-1-1 calls were unable\nto be made and other government services, hospital emergency systems, and border crossings\nwere impacted. Rogers explained that the outage was a result of a network system failure\nfollowing an update in its core IP network and that they would explore how they could work\nwith other Canadian carriers to avoid future widespread outages. They would also credit all\ncustomers with the equivalent of five days of service fees.\n• Bank of Canada Interest Rate Hikes: The Bank of Canada increased its key interest rate by a full\npercentage point on July 13th, 2022 and another 0.75 points on September 7th, 2022 to sit at\n3.25%.",

This was following three previous rate hikes in March, April, and June in an effort to curb\nrising inflation and cool a hot market by discouraging consumer spending. We’ve already seen\nhousing prices and sales decrease in Q2 and Q3 as mortgage and loan rates rise. Further interest\nrate hikes are expected to hit 4.0% by the end of the year.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ3-2021 Q2-2022 Q3-2022 Status Compared to\nQ3-2021\nEmployed Labour 596,200 609,800 607,600 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 6.2% 4.7% 3.7% ✓\nPositive\nParticipation Rate 68.7% 67.8% 66.6% \nNegative\nHousing Starts 2,097 2,144 4,598 ✓\nPositive\nAverage Resale Price $687,343 $801,524 $710,241 \nNegative\nResale Units Sold 4,903 3,941 2,506 \nNegative\nPopulation N/A 1,056,750 N/A \nNeutral\nInflation 4.9% 7.4% 7.2% \nNegative\nAverage Weekly $1,293",

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q3 2023\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q3 2023 update covers the months of July, August, and\nSeptember 2023. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q4 2023: October, November, December 2023\n• Plans to boost housing supply announced by the City and federal government: The City’s\nPlanning and Housing Committee approved a plan to lower fees and streamline the approval\nprocess to convert vacant office space to residential units to boost housing supply. The federal\ngovernment has also announced that it would build over 1,600 homes across three of its\nproperties in Ottawa, of which 221 affordable units are planned. In addition, the fall federal\nfiscal update included $15 billion in new loan funding for the Apartment Construction Loan\nProgram, $1 billion in direct funding over three years for the Affordable Housing Fund, and\nmeasures to crack down on short-term rentals to free up existing housing supply.\n• More direct flights, increased service, and a new budget airline coming to Ottawa: In response\nto high demand, Porter Airlines has announced that it will be increasing service on eight routes\nto destinations in Canada and the U.S. next spring and summer as well as offering new direct\nroutes to Calgary and Winnipeg starting in February and May 2024. A new budget airline, Lynx\nAir, will also be launching service to Ottawa starting next spring.\n• Council approves Lansdowne 2.0 renewal plan: On November 9th, City Council approved the\nLansdowne 2.0 plan which includes the construction of two residential towers, a two-storey\nretail space, a new mid-size event centre, and new north-side stadium stands. The existing\nnorth-side stands and arena are functionally obsolete and would require costly maintenance. By\nreplacing these facilities, the hope is that it will attract major events to Ottawa, increasing\npotential City revenues and supporting Lansdowne businesses. Taxpayers will pay about a third\nof the $419-million-dollar capital cost and the approved plan will deliver new City-owned\nfacilities for a net cost of about $5 million a year after factoring in revenues from the sale of\n1\nsubterranean and air rights, of which 50 per cent of the revenue will be directed to the\naffordable housing reserve.\nWhat Happened in Q3 2023: July, August, September 2023\n• GST and HST to be removed from new rental developments: A new bill was passed by the\nfederal government in September that will remove GST charges from new purpose-built rentals\nto help address the housing and affordability crisis. Projects that began construction on or after\nSeptember 14th until the end of 2030 will be eligible as long as construction is completed by\n2035. Following suit, the provincial government has also agreed to remove its eight per cent\nportion of HST from new purpose-built rentals.\n• Bank of Canada interest rate hike: The Bank of Canada raised the key interest rate to 5% in July,\nthe highest it’s been since 2001, in an effort to bring inflation back down to 2%. It has been kept\nsteady at 5% for the remainder of 2023 as signs of economic softening, such as rising\nunemployment rates and a decrease in GDP, have been observed.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ3-2022 Q2-2023 Q3-2023 Status Compared to\nQ3-2022\nEmployed Labour 610,800 632,000 650,100 \nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 3.9% 4.3% 4.9% \nNegative\nParticipation Rate 67.1% 68.3% 70.0% \nPositive\nHousing Starts 4,598 1,688 2,797 \nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $641,800 $673,865 $666,023 \nNegative\nResale Units Sold 3,327 5,085 3,405 \nPositive\nPopulation N/A 1,077,900 N/A \nNeutral\nInflation 7.2% 3.8% 3.2% \nPositive\nAverage Weekly $1,308 $1,413 $1,400 \nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $1,048,035 $844,745 $719,242 \nNegative\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 10.6% 12.9% 12.6% \nNegative\nRetail Vacancy Rate N/A 2.9% N/A \nNeutral\nIndustrial Vacancy 2.0% 2.2% 2.6% \nNegative\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n3\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\n6.0%\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q3-22 Q2-23 Q3-23 5.0%\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 635.9 660.5 683.5\n4.0%\nEmployed (x 1,000) 610.8 632.0 650.1\n3.0%\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 25.1 28.5 33.4\nUnemployment Rate 3.9% 4.3% 4.9% 2.0%\nParticipation Rate 67.1% 68.3% 70.0% 1.0%\n*2016 boundaries\n0.0%\nYear-over-year, the overall labour force increased 7.5%\nwhile employed residents increased by 6.4%.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate also increased 1.0\npercentage points from Q3 2022.

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q3 2024\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q3 2024 update covers the months of July, August, and\nSeptember 2024. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an email\nsubscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q4 2024: October, November, December 2024\n• Ottawa’s GDP Growth Hits 2.5% in Q4 2024: Ottawa’s economy grew by 2.5% in the fourth quarter\nof 2024, outperforming the national average. The technology sector, tourism, and retail industries\nwere key drivers of growth andanalysts attribute this success to strategic public investments and a\nresilient workforce. Some factors cited as insulating the city from global economic uncertainties\nwere Ottawa’s diversified economy and strong governance. Continued growth is anticipated in\n2025, supported by ongoing infrastructure projects\n• Unemployment Rate Falls to 4.6%: Ottawa’s unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in Q4 2024, the lowest\nin five years. The decline reflects robust job creation in healthcare, technology, and clean energy\nsectors. Workforce development programs and incentives for businesses relocating to Ottawa have\nplayed a significant role in this achievement. Economists predict that the trend will continue into\n2025, further solidifying Ottawa’s economic stability.\n• Federal Funding Secured for Ottawa's Tourism Recovery: Ottawa secured $30 million in federal\nfunding to support its tourism recovery strategy. Funds will be allocated to marketing campaigns,\ninfrastructure upgrades, and new events. Tourism officials project the funding will generate $100\nmillion in economic activity over two years, boosting hotel occupancy and local business revenues.\n• Tech Giant Opens Quantum Computing Lab in Ottawa: A major technology corporation announced\nthe opening of a state-of-the-art Quantum Computing Lab in Ottawa. The $60 million investment\nwill focus on advancing quantum algorithms for artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. This\ninitiative will generate 200 high-paying jobs and foster partnerships with academic institutions in the\nregion.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q3 2024: July, August, and September 2024\n• City Approves Comprehensive Green Building Policy: The City of Ottawa unveiled a new Green\nBuilding Policy to promote sustainable construction practices across municipal and private\ndevelopments. The policy mandates energy-efficient designs, low-carbon materials, and renewable\nenergy integration for all new municipal buildings. The initiative aims to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions by 50% by 2030, aligning with Ottawa’s Climate Change Master Plan. Economic analysts\nforecast long-term savings on operational costs and significant job creation in the green\nconstruction sector. Industry stakeholders have lauded the policy as a critical step in positioning\nOttawa as a leader in sustainable urban development.\n• Federal Housing Accelerator Fund Allocates $30M to Ottawa: The Federal Housing Accelerator\nFund awarded Ottawa $30 million to expedite affordable housing projects. The funding will\nstreamline approval processes, enhance infrastructure in high-demand areas, and finance the\nconstruction of over 800 new units. Ottawa’s initiative focuses on addressing homelessness and\nproviding affordable housing for low-income families and seniors. Local leaders highlighted this as a\npivotal moment for achieving housing equity while boosting the local economy through\nconstruction-related employment.\n• Lansdowne Park Redevelopment Plan Approved: The City of Ottawa approved a $300 million\nredevelopment plan for Lansdowne Park, including new residential units, retail spaces, and public\namenities. The project is expected to create 2,000 construction jobs and drive long-term economic\nbenefits through increased tourism and local spending.\n• The federal government identified 56 properties for conversion to affordable housing, including\n22 properties in Ottawa: The Canada Public Land Bank, launched on August 25, 2024, features 56\nfederal properties across Canada, including 22 in the city of Ottawa, that have been identified as\nbeing able to support housing. Former military bases, Canada Post sites and federal office buildings\nare among the properties currently included in the public lands bank, many of which were\npreviously set aside for sale as they are no longer in use. The new plan is to offer most of the\nproperties for long-term lease rather than one-time sale to keep the lands in public hands and\nensure housing built on them remains affordable. The current list includes properties in 28\nmunicipalities in seven provinces but will grow over time through an ongoing review of underused\nor vacant federal land and buildings.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ3-2023 Q2-2024 Q3-2024 Year-over-year Status:\nQ3 2024 Compared to\nQ3-2023\nEmployed Labour 650,100 646,133 658,133 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 4.9% 5.6% 6.4% ✗\nNegative\nParticipation Rate 70.0% 68.0% 69.1% ✗\nNegative\nHousing Starts 2,797 1,450 2,500 ✗\nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $666,023 $694,112 $675,167 ✓\nPositive\nResale Units Sold 3,405 4,440 3,388 ✗\nNegative\nPopulation* N/A 1,094,340 N/A ○\nNeutral\nInflation 3.1% 2.6% 2.4% ✓\nPositive\nAverage Weekly $1,400 $1,455 $1,445 ✓\nPositive\nEarning\nConstruction Permit $726,036 $991,874 $843,79 ✓\nPositive\nValue\n(seasonally adjusted)\nOffice Vacancy Rate 12.6% 11.5% 11.5% ✓\nPositive\nRetail Vacancy Rate 1.7% 1.9% 2.1% ✗\nNegative\nIndustrial Vacancy 2.6% 3.5% 4.4% ✗\nNegative\nRate\nPlease refer to individual tables below for more details.\n*Population data is available bi-annually for quarters Q2 and Q4.\n3\n7.0%\n6.0%\n5.0%\n4.0%\n3.0%\n2.0%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n4\n22-tcO 22-ceD 32-beF 32-rpA 32-nuJ 32-guA 32-tcO 32-ceD 42-beF 42-rpA 42-nuJ 42-guA\nUnemployment Rate\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n22-tcO 22-ceD 32-beF 32-rpA 32-nuJ 32-guA 32-tcO 32-ceD 42-beF 42-rpA 42-nuJ 42-guA\nLabour Force\nLabour Force, Seasonally Adjusted, 3-Month\nMoving Average\nSource: Statistics Canada, Table 14-10-0380-01\nOttawa, CMA (ON pt.)* Q3-23 Q2-24 Q3-24\nLabour Force (x 1,000) 683.5 684.2 702.8\nEmployed (x 1,000) 650.1 646.1 658.1\nUnemployed (x 1,000) 33.4 38.1 44.7\nUnemployment Rate 4.9% 5.6% 6.4%\nParticipation Rate 70.0% 68.0% 69.1%\n*2021 boundaries\nYear-over-year, the overall labour force increased 2.8%\nwhile employed residents increased by 3.9%.

      ".\n• Lansdowne Park Redevelopment Plan Approved: The City of Ottawa approved a $300 million\nredevelopment plan for Lansdowne Park, including new residential units, retail spaces, and public\namenities. The project is expected to create 2,000 construction jobs and drive long-term economic\nbenefits through increased tourism and local spending.\n• The federal government identified 56 properties for conversion to affordable housing, including\n22 properties in Ottawa: The Canada Public Land Bank, launched on August 25, 2024, features 56\nfederal properties across Canada, including 22 in the city of Ottawa, that have been identified as\nbeing able to support housing.

      "es, Canada Post sites and federal office buildings\nare among the properties currently included in the public lands bank, many of which were\npreviously set aside for sale as they are no longer in use. The new plan is to offer most of the\nproperties for long-term lease rather than one-time sale to keep the lands in public hands and\nensure housing built on them remains affordable. The current list includes properties in 28\nmunicipalities in seven provinces but will grow over time through an ongoing review of underused\nor vacant federal land and buildings.\n2\nSnapshot\nQ3-2023 Q2-2024 Q3-2024 Year-over-year Status:\nQ3 2024 Compared to\nQ3-2023\nEmployed Labour 650,100 646,133 658,133 ✓\nPositive\nForce\nUnemployment Rate 4.9% 5.6% 6.4% ✗\nNegative\nParticipation Rate 70.0% 68.0% 69.1% ✗\nNegative\nHousing Starts 2,797 1,450 2,500 ✗\nNegative\nAverage Resale Price $666,023 $694,112 $675,167 ✓\nPositive\nResale Units Sold 3,405 4,440 3,388 ✗\nNegative\nPopulation* N/A 1,094,340 N/A ○\nNeutral\nInflation 3.1% 2",

    "content": "Economic Development Update Q4 2022\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q4 2022 update covers the months of October,\nNovember, and December 2022. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via\nan email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q1 2023: January, February, March 2023\n• Federal Employees Return to the Office: By March 31, 2023, federal public servants will be\nrequired to return to the office 2-3 days per week. The move to a hybrid work arrangement will\nbe a phased transition starting January 16th, 2023, in order to ensure fairness and equity to\nhybrid work across the federal government. Unions have opposed the mandate, saying it is\nunjustified and that taxpayer money is saved having employees work from home, while Mayor\nMark Sutcliffe and businesses downtown applaud the decision that is expected to benefit the\npublic transit system and local economy.\n• Vacant Unit Tax: Housing sale prices and rents have increased as Ottawa’s housing supply hasn’t\nkept up with demand, making finding a place to live difficult for many residents. The Vacant Unit\nTax is an incentive to get existing properties on the market to rent or sell in an effort to increase\nOttawa’s housing stock. All revenues are to go directly into the City’s fund for more affordable\nhousing. The tax will be applicable starting in 2023 and the deadline to declare the occupancy\nstatus of a residential property is March 16, 2023. Declarations can be made at Ottawa.ca/vut\n• First time the Rideau Canal did not open: Due to this winter’s fluctuating temperatures, the ice\non the Rideau Canal Skateway has not been able to get thick enough to safely open for skating.\nThis is the first year the canal has not been able to open in its 53-year history, which has been\nhard on the local tourism economy as a main attraction during Winterlude. A climate change risk\nassessment commissioned by the NCC warns that later and shorter skating seasons on the canal\ncould become the norm with warmer and wetter weather. The NCC has been experimenting\nwith new ice-making methods in response.\n1\n• New direct flight route between Europe and Ottawa: On February 2nd, 2023, Air France\nannounced that it will launch flights between the Ottawa International Airport and Paris Charles\nde Gaulle Airport starting in June. This will be the first direct route between Ottawa and Europe\nsince 2020 with the hope to restore international business and leisure travel to the National\nCapital Region and boost the local tourism economy.\nWhat Happened in Q4 2022: October, November, December 2022\n• Ottawa’s Municipal Election: Mark Sutcliffe became Ottawa’s new mayor with over 51% of the\nvotes. A broadcaster and entrepreneur, he campaigned on fiscal frugality and “cross-partisan”\nsupport. He promises to keep property tax increases at 2.5% in 2023 and 2024 and to cut $35\nmillion in municipal spending.

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q4 2023\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q4 2023 update covers the months of October,\nNovember, December 2023. This report will be available on a quarterly basis on Ottawa.ca and via an\nemail subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q1 2023: January, February, March 2023\n• City to receive funding to boost housing supply from the federal and provincial governments:\nFollowing the City of Ottawa’s application to the Housing Accelerator Fund, the federal\ngovernment has pledged to provide $176 million to fast-track over 4,400 residential units over\nthe next three years and over 32,000 units over the next decade. In order to receive the funding,\nthe City has committed to nine separate actions to boost housing construction, including using\nfunds to support non-profit affordable housing and removing barriers to converting office space\ninto residential units. The provincial government has also announced on its online housing\ntracker that Ottawa will be eligible to receive funding from the $1.2 billion Building Faster Fund\nafter having surpassed 80% of our annual housing target for 2023 with 10,313 new units.\n• Major development projects proposed by Brigil to bring over 4,000 units: Brigil is hoping to\nstart construction later this year on a mixed-use development at the site of the former\nGreyhound bus terminal on Catherine Street. It is to eventually contain three high-rises with\nover 1,000 residential units. The developer has also proposed to create a complete\nneighbourhood with over 3,000 residential units and 100,000 sq m of commercial space for\nphase 3 of Petrie’s Landing. Both projects are currently going through the approval process.\n• Porter, Air France, and United Airlines plan to increase service to Ottawa: Passenger traffic is\nexpected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year at the Ottawa International Airport as\nairlines continue to increase service. Air France is to increase the number of Ottawa-Paris flights,\nUnited Airlines is to increase the number of flights between Ottawa and Washington, and Porter\nAirlines has also announced that it intends to continue expanding its offerings.\n1\nWhat Happened in Q4 2023: October, November, December 2023\n• Plans to boost housing supply announced by the City and federal government: The City’s\nPlanning and Housing Committee approved a plan to lower fees and streamline the approval\nprocess to convert vacant office space to residential units to boost housing supply. The federal\ngovernment has also announced that it would build over 1,600 homes across three of its\nproperties in Ottawa, of which 221 affordable units are planned. In addition, the fall federal\nfiscal update included $15 billion in new loan funding for the Apartment Construction Loan\nProgram, $1 billion in direct funding over three years for the Affordable Housing Fund, and\nmeasures to crack down on short-term rentals to free up existing housing supply.\n• Council approves Lansdowne 2.0 renewal plan: On November 9th, City Council approved the\nLansdowne 2.0 plan which includes the construction of two residential towers, a two-storey\nretail space, a new mid-size event centre, and new north-side stadium stands. The existing\nnorth-side stands and arena are functionally obsolete and would require costly maintenance. By\nreplacing these facilities, the hope is that it will attract major events to Ottawa, increasing\npotential City revenues and supporting Lansdowne businesses.

    "content": "Economic Development Update – Q4 2024\nThe City of Ottawa Economic Development Update provides an overview of quarterly and annual\neconomic indicators to the city’s economy. The Q4 2024 update covers the months of October,\nNovember and December 2024. This report will be available on Ottawa.ca and via an email subscription.\nNew and Noteworthy in Q1 2025: January, February and March 2025\n• Bank of Canada Warns of Economic Impact from Prolonged U.S. Trade Conflict: The Bank of\nCanada has expressed concerns that a prolonged trade conflict with the United States could\npermanently reduce Canada's GDP. In response to potential U.S. tariffs, the Bank has reduced its\nkey policy rate to 3%, marking the sixth consecutive reduction. The governing council noted that\nongoing trade tensions may lead to decreased economic activity, higher inflation, and a weakened\nCanadian dollar. Some Canadian businesses are considering relocating to the U.S., which could\nexacerbate capital flight and harm competitiveness. The Bank will continue to monitor the\nsituation closely, especially regarding supply chains and sectoral impacts. Source: Reuters\n• Ottawa's Economy Shows Resilience Amidst U.S. Tariffs: Despite the imposition of a 25% tariff\non all Canadian imports by the U.S. on February 1, 2025, Ottawa's economy is expected to remain\nresilient. Factors contributing to this outlook include declining interest rates and ongoing\ninfrastructure projects, such as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) expansion. These elements are\nanticipated to mitigate potential negative impacts, supporting continued economic growth in the\nregion. Source: Ottawa Business Journal\n• Launch of Downtown Vibrancy Office to Revitalize Ottawa's Core: At the start of 2025, Ottawa\nintroduced a new \"downtown vibrancy office\" aimed at rejuvenating the city's core. Supported\nby a $450,000 grant from the provincial government's $20-million \"New Deal\" for Ottawa, the\noffice focuses on initiatives to attract businesses, residents, and visitors to the downtown area.\nEfforts include enhancing public spaces, supporting local events, and collaborating with\nstakeholders to address challenges such as commercial vacancies. This initiative seeks to stimulate\neconomic activity, foster a vibrant urban environment, and reinforce Ottawa's position as a\ndynamic capital city. Source: Ottawa Business Journal\n• Ottawa's Trillium Line Expansion Enhances Transit Connectivity: The Trillium Line, part of\nOttawa's O-Train light rail system, has undergone a significant expansion as part of the Stage 2\nLight Rail Transit (LRT) project. The extension adds 11 kilometers of new track, extending the line\nsouth from Greenboro to Limebank, with new stations at South Keys, Leitrim, Bowesville, and\nLimebank. Additionally, a 4-kilometer branch line now connects South Keys station to Macdonald-\nCartier International Airport, enhancing transit accessibility for travelers. This expansion, which\n1\nbegan operations on January 6, 2025, is expected to improve public transportation options,\nreduce traffic congestion, and support economic growth in the region by facilitating easier\nmovement for residents and visitors alike. Source: OC-Transpo\nWhat Happened in Q4 2024: October, November and December 2024\n• Ontario-Ottawa Agreement Secures $48 Million for Public Safety Initiatives: The Ontario\nSolicitor General and Treasury Board have endorsed seven public safety initiatives under the\nOntario-Ottawa Agreement, allocating $48 million over three years to enhance community safety.\nThis funding supports evidence-based approaches and contemporary best practices, focusing on\ncommunity engagement and partnerships to address safety issues holistically. The initiatives aim\nto strengthen Ottawa's resilience and ensure a secure environment for all residents, contributing\npositively to the city's economic stability and attractiveness for investment. Source: City of Ottawa\n• Rural Summit 2024 Addresses Service Improvements for Ottawa's Rural Communities: The Rural\nSummit 2024, held in October, focused on recommending improvements to city services for\nOttawa's rural residents and communities. A Resident Working Group, formed in January 2024\nwith representatives from each rural ward, organized the summit to address issues specific to\nrural areas, including service delivery, future planning, and community development. The summit\naimed to foster better communication between rural stakeholders and city officials, ensuring that\nthe unique needs of these communities are met. Enhancing services in rural Ottawa is expected\nto support local economies, particularly in agriculture and small businesses, contributing to the\noverall economic health of the region. Source: City of Ottawa\n• Ottawa Senators Secure Agreement for New Arena at LeBreton Flats: The Ottawa Senators, in\npartnership with the National Capital Commission (NCC), have reached an agreement to construct\na new arena in the LeBreton Flats district. This development is part of a broader mixed-use project\naimed at revitalizing the area. The new arena is expected to boost local employment during and\nafter construction, stimulate investment, and enhance Ottawa's appeal as a destination for major\nevents and entertainment. The project underscores the city's commitment to urban renewal and\neconomic diversification. Source: CTV News\n• Ottawa's Real Estate Market Sees Increase in Listings and Sales in 2024: The Ottawa Real Estate\nBoard (OREB) reported a notable rise in active residential listings and home sales throughout\n2024. As of November 30, there were 4,036 active residential listings, marking a 38.2% increase\ncompared to the same period in 2023. Home sales in November 2024 totaled 1,059 units,\nreflecting an 11.8% increase from November 2023. The benchmark price for single-family homes\nreached $722,400, a 2.1% year-over-year rise, while townhouses saw a modest 0.3% increase to\n$491,500. Conversely, apartment prices experienced a 3.7% decline, with the benchmark price at\n$406,200. OREB attributes the market's recovery to buyers gradually returning, influenced by\nstabilizing interest rates and upcoming changes in mortgage regulations. This trend suggests a\nstrengthening housing market in Ottawa, potentially boosting economic activity and consumer\nconfidence in the region.
